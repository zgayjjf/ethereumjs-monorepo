## 5.0.0 - 2022-09-06

Final release - tada üéâ - of a wider breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes for the main long change set description as well as the Beta 2, Beta 3 and Release Candidate (RC) 1 release notes for notes on some additional changes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/trie/CHANGELOG.md)).

### Trie Pruning

Some great last minute feature (thanks @faustbrian and @jochem-brouwer on this!) allowing to prune a trie on state root updates with a new `useNodePruning` option (default: `false`), see PR [#2203](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2203). This allows for a much smaller DB footprint for the trie for use cases with frequent state root updates.

- Internal refactor: removed ambiguous boolean checks within conditional clauses, PR [#2249](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2249)

## 5.0.0-rc.1 - 2022-08-29

Release candidate 1 for the upcoming breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes for the main long change set description as well as the Beta 2 and 3 release notes for notes on some additional changes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/trie/CHANGELOG.md)).

From Beta 3 to RC 1 the `Trie` library has seen the most vast set of changes, thanks again to @faustbrian for this various meaningful refactoring contributions! ‚ù§Ô∏è

There are various substantial structural changes and reworkings which will make working with the Trie library more flexible and robust. Note that these changes will need some attention though on an upgrade depending on your existing usage of the Trie library.

### Single Trie Class

There is now one single `Trie` class which contains and exposes the functionality previously split into the three separate classes `Trie` -> `CheckpointTrie` and `SecureTrie`, see PRs [#2214](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2214) and [#2215](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2215). Class inheritance has been removed and the existing functionality has been integrated into one class. This should make it easier to extend the Trie class or customize its behavior without having to "dock" into the previous complicated inheritance structure.

#### Default Checkpointing Behavior

The `CheckpointTrie` class has been removed in favor of integrating the functionality into the main `Trie` class and make it a default behaviour. Every Trie instance now comes complete with checkpointing behaviour out of the box, without giving any additional weight or performance penalty if the functionality remains unused.

#### Secure Trie with an Option

The `SecureTrie` class has been removed as well. Instead there is a new constructor option `useKeyHashing` - defaulting to `false`. This effectively reduces the level of inheritance dependencies (for example, in the old structure, you could not create a secure trie without the checkpoint functionality which, in terms of logic, do not correlate in any way). This also provides more room to accommodate future design modifications and/or additions if required.

Updating is a straightforward process:

```ts
// Old
const trie = new SecureTrie()

// New
const trie = new Trie({ useKeyHashing: true })
```

### Removed Getter and Setter Functions

Due to the ambiguity of the `get` and `set` functions (also known as getters and setters), usage has been removed from the library. This is because their ambiguity can create the impression of interacting with a property on a trie instance.

#### Trie `root` Getter/Setter

For this reason, a single `root(hash?: Buffer): Buffer` function serves as a replacement for the previous `root` getter and setter and can effectively work to get and set properties, see PR [#2219](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2219). This makes it obvious that you intend to modify an internal property of the trie that is neither accessible or mutable via any other means other than this particular function.

##### Getter Example

```tsx
// Old
const trie = new Trie()
trie.root

// New
const trie = new Trie()
trie.root()
```

##### Setter Example

```tsx
// Old
const trie = new Trie()
trie.root = Buffer.alloc(32)

// New
const trie = new Trie()
trie.root(Buffer.alloc(32))
```

#### Trie `isCheckpoint` Getter

The `isCheckpoint` getter function has been removed, see PR [#2218](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2218) The `hasCheckpoints()` function serves as its replacement and offers the same behaviour.

```tsx
// Old
const trie = new Trie()
trie.isCheckpoint

// New
const trie = new Trie()
trie.hasCheckpoints()
```

### Database Abstraction

Another significant change is that we dropped support for `LevelDB` out of the box. As a result, you will need to have your own implementation available.

#### Motivation

The primary reason for this change is increase the flexibility of this package by allowing developers to select any type of storage for their unique purposes. In addition, this change renders the project far less susceptible to [supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack). We trust that users and developers can appreciate the value of reducing this attack surface in exchange for a little more time spent on their part for the duration of this upgrade.

#### LevelDB Removal

Prior to v5, this package shipped with a LevelDB integration out of the box. Finalized within this RC release round we have introduced a database abstraction and therefore no longer ship with the aforementioned LevelDB implementation, see previous Beta CHANGELOGs as well as PR [#2167](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2167). However, for your convenience, we provide all of the necessary steps so that you can integrate it accordingly.

See our [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/trie/UPGRADING.md) for more instructions on how to use the `Trie` library with LevelDB now.

### Other Changes

- Renamed `Semaphore` to `Lock`, PR [#2234](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2234)

## 5.0.0-beta.3 - 2022-08-10

Beta 3 release for the upcoming breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes for the main long change set description as well as the Beta 2 release notes for notes on some additional changes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/devp2p/CHANGELOG.md)).

### Root Hash Persistance

The trie library now comes with a new constructor option `useRootPersistence` (note that the option has been called `persistRoot` up to Beta 3) which is disabled by default but allows to persist state root updates along write operations directly in the DB and therefore omits the need to manually set to a new state root, see PR [#2071](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2071) and PR [#2123](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2123), thanks to @faustbrian for the contribution! ‚ù§Ô∏è

To activate root hash persistance you can set the `useRootPersistence` option on instantiation:

```typescript
import { Trie, LevelDB } from '@ethereumjs/trie'
import { Level } from 'level'

const trie = new Trie({
  db: new LevelDB(new Level('MY_TRIE_DB_LOCATION')),
  useRootPersistence: true,
})
```

### Other Changes

- Fix: Pass down a custom hash function for hashing on trie copies, PR [#2068](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2068)

# 5.0.0-beta.2 - 2022-07-15

Beta 2 release for the upcoming breaking release round on the [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries, see the Beta 1 release notes ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/trie/CHANGELOG.md)) for the main change set description.

### Removed Default Exports

The change with the biggest effect on UX since the last Beta 1 releases is for sure that we have removed default exports all accross the monorepo, see PR [#2018](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2018), we even now added a new linting rule that completely disallows using.

Default exports were a common source of error and confusion when using our libraries in a CommonJS context, leading to issues like Issue [#978](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/978).

Now every import is a named import and we think the long term benefits will very much outweigh the one-time hassle of some import adoptions.

So if you use the Trie library together with other EthereumJS libraries check if the respetive imports need an update.

## Custom Hash Function

There is a new constructor option `hash` which allows to customize the hash function used for secure trie key hashing - see PR [#2043](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2043) - thanks to @libotony for the great contribution on this! ‚ù§Ô∏è

This allows to swap out the applied `keccak256` hash functionality from the [@noble/hashes](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes) library and e.g. use a faster native implementation or an alternative hash function (the PR contribution e.g. was done with the goal to switch to `blake2b256` hashing).

**Breaking:** Note that this change made it necessary to switch the current proof functionality methods from static to object-bound member functions.

So the usage of the following methods change and need to be updated (for all types of tries):

- `Trie.createProof(trie, myKey)` -> `trie.createProof(myKey)`
- `Trie.verifyProof(trie.root(), myKey, proof)` -> `trie.verifyProof(trie.root(), myKey, proof)`
- `Trie.verifyRangeProof(...)` -> `trie.verifyRangeProof(...)`

## Other Changes

- Added `ESLint` strict boolean expressions linting rule, PR [#2030](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2030)

# 5.0.0-beta.1 - 2022-06-30

This release is part of a larger breaking release round where all [EthereumJS monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) libraries (VM, Tx, Trie, other) get major version upgrades. This round of releases has been prepared for a long time and we are really pleased with and proud of the result, thanks to all team members and contributors who worked so hard and made this possible! üôÇ ‚ù§Ô∏è

We have gotten rid of a lot of technical debt and inconsistencies and removed unused functionality, renamed methods, improved on the API and on TypeScript typing, to name a few of the more local type of refactoring changes. There are also broader structural changes like a full transition to native JavaScript `BigInt` values as well as various somewhat deep-reaching refactorings, both within a single package as well as some reaching beyond the scope of a single package. Also two completely new packages - `@ethereumjs/evm` (in addition to the existing `@ethereumjs/vm` package) and `@ethereumjs/statemanager` - have been created, leading to a more modular Ethereum JavaScript VM.

We are very much confident that users of the libraries will greatly benefit from the changes being introduced. However - along the upgrade process - these releases require some extra attention and care since the changeset is both so big and deep reaching. We highly recommend to closely read the release notes, we have done our best to create a full picture on the changes with some special emphasis on delicate code and API parts and give some explicit guidance on how to upgrade and where problems might arise!

So, enjoy the releases (this is a first round of Beta releases, with final releases following a couple of weeks after if things go well)! üéâ

### New Package Name

**Attention!** This library release aligns (and therefore: changes!) the library name with the other EthereumJS libraries and switches to the new scoped package name format, see PR [#1953](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1953). In this case the library is renamed as follows:

- `merkle-patricia-tree` -> `@ethereumjs/trie`

Please update your library references accordingly and install with:

```shell
npm i @ethereumjs/trie
```

### BigInt Introduction / ES2020 Build Target

With this round of breaking releases the whole EthereumJS library stack removes the [BN.js](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/) library and switches to use native JavaScript [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) values for large-number operations and interactions.

This makes the libraries more secure and robust (no more BN.js v4 vs v5 incompatibilities) and generally comes with substantial performance gains for the large-number-arithmetic-intense parts of the libraries (particularly the VM).

While the Trie library currently has no specific BigInt usage we have generally updated our build target to [ES2020](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/) to allow for BigInt support now or for future functionality additions. We feel that some still remaining browser compatibility issues on the edges (old Safari versions e.g.) are justified by the substantial gains this step brings along.

See [#1671](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1671) and [#1771](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1771) for the core `BigInt` transition PRs.

### Disabled esModuleInterop and allowSyntheticDefaultImports TypeScript Compiler Options

The above TypeScript options provide some semantic sugar like allowing to write an import like `import React from "react"` instead of `import * as React from "react"`, see [esModuleInterop](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop) and [allowSyntheticDefaultImports](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowSyntheticDefaultImports) docs for some details.

While this is convenient it deviates from the ESM specification and forces downstream users into these options which might not be desirable, see [this TypeScript Semver docs section](https://www.semver-ts.org/#module-interop) for some more detailed argumentation.

Along the breaking releases we have therefore deactivated both of these options and you might therefore need to adopt some import statements accordingly. Note that you still have got the possibility to activate these options in your bundle and/or transpilation pipeline (but now you also have the option to _not_ do which you didn't have before).

### Database Changes

#### Generic DB Interface

In the last round of breaking release preparation @faustbrian came around the corner and came up with some really great DB-related additions to the Trie library, thanks so much for these super valuable contributions! ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è

Trie usage has now been decoupled from the tight integration with `LevelDB` and it is now possible to replace the datastore with an own implementation respectively a DB wrapper to an alternative key-value-store solution.

For this there is now a generic `DB` interface defining five methods `get`, `put`, `del`, `batch` and `copy` which a specific `DB` wrapper needs to implement. For `LevelDB` a wrapper with the same name is included and can be directly used.

The base trie implementation (`Trie`) as well as all subclass implementations (`CheckpointTrie` and `SecureTrie`) have been reworked to now accept any `DB` interface-compatible wrapper implementations as a datastore `db` option input. This allows to easily switch on the underlying backend.

The new `DB` interface can be used like this for LevelDB:

```typescript
import { Trie, LevelDB } from '@ethereumjs/trie'
import { Level } from 'level'

const trie = new Trie({ db: new LevelDB(new Level('MY_TRIE_DB_LOCATION')) })
```

If no `db` option is provided an in-memory [memory-level](https://github.com/Level/memory-level) data storage will be instantiated and used. (Side note: some internal non-persistent trie operations (e.g. proof trie creation for range proofs) will always use the internal `level` based data storage, so there will be some continued `level` DB usage also when you switch to an alternative data store for permanent trie storage).

#### Level DB Upgrade / Browser Compatibility

Along with the DB interface extraction the internal Level DB code has been reworked to now be based and work with the latest Level [v8.0.0](https://github.com/Level/level/releases/tag/v8.0.0) major Level DB release. This allows to use ES6-style `import` syntax to import the `Level` instance and allows for better typing when working with Level DB.

Because of the upgrade, any `level` implementation compliant with the `abstract-level` interface can be use, including `classic-level`, `browser-level` and `memory-level`. This now makes it a lot easier to use the package in browsers without polyfills for `level`. For some context it is worth to mention that the `level` package itself is starting with the v8 release just a proxy for these other packages and has no functionality itself.

### API Changes

Options for the Trie constructor are now also taken in as an options dict like in the other EthereumJS libaries. This makes it easier to add additional options in the future, see PR [#1874](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1874).

Check your Trie instantiations and see if you use constructor options. In this case you need to update to the new format:

- `constructor(db?: LevelUp | null, root?: Buffer, deleteFromDB: boolean = false)` -> `constructor(opts: TrieOpts = {})`

The following deprecated or semi-private methods have been removed, see PR [#1874](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1874) and PR [#1834](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1834).

- `setRoot()` (use `Trie.root` instead)
- Semi-private `_walkTrie()` and `_lookupNode()` methods (should not but might have been used directly)

### New File Layout

The trie source files have been reorganized to provide a more consistent and clean file and folder layout, see PR [#1972](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1972). This might or might not affect you, depending if you use direct file references for importing (if you do you might want to generally switch to use root-level exports from the main `index.ts` file).

All types and Trie options are now bundled in a dedicated `types.ts` file and there are dedicated folders for the different Trie implementations (`trie/`), DB interfaces and classes (`db/`) and proof-related functionality (`proof/`). Additionally some utility functionality has been moved to the `util/` folder.

# 4.2.4 - 2022-03-15

- New `Trie.verifyRangeProof()` function to check whether the given leaf nodes and edge proof can prove the given trie leaves range is matched with the specific root (useful for snapsync, thanks to @samlior for this generous code contribution ‚ù§Ô∏è), PR [#1731](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1731)

# 4.2.3 - 2022-02-01

- Dependencies: deduplicated RLP import, PR [#1549](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1549)

# 4.2.2 - 2021-10-06

**Bug Fixes**

- Adds try-catch for "Missing node in DB" in ReadStream, PR [#1515](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1515)

## 4.2.1 - 2021-08-17

**Bug Fixes**

- Better error checking for invalid proofs with a differentiation on proofs of non-existence (`Trie.verifyProof()` returns `null`) and invalid proofs where `Trie.verifyProof()` will throw, see [README section](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/trie#merkle-proofs) for further details, PR [#1373](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1373)

**Maintenance**

- Remove use of deprecated setRoot, PR [#1376](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1376)

### Included Source Files

Source files from the `src` folder are now included in the distribution build, see PR [#1301](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1301). This allows for a better debugging experience in debug tools like Chrome DevTools by having working source map references to the original sources available for inspection.

## 4.2.0 - 2021-05-20

### Changed Delete Behavior: NO Default Node Deletes

This release changes the behavior on trie node deletes after doing a `commit()` on a checkpoint trie (`CheckpointTrie`). This was the scenario where trie nodes were deleted from the database in older versions of the library. After a long discussion we decided to switch to a more conservative approach and keep the trie nodes in the DB in all scenarios. This now allows for setting back the state root to an older root (e.g. with the `StateManager` included in the `VM`) and still be sure to operate on a consistent and complete trie. This had been reported as a problem in some usage scenarios by third-party users of the library.

So the default behavior on the trie is now: there are no node deletions happening in all type of setups and usage scenarios, so for a `BaseTrie`, `CheckpointTrie` or `SecureTrie` and working checkpointed or non-checkpointed.

While this change is not directly breaking, it might nevertheless have side effects depending on your usage scenario. If you use a somewhat larger trie and do a lot of change operations, this will significantly increase the disk space used. We have nevertheless decided to make this a non-breaking release since we don't expect this to be the usual way the trie library is used. Instead the former behavior appeared more as some sort of "bug" when reported by developers integrating the library.

If you want to switch back to a trie where nodes are deleted (so for non-checkpointed tries directly along a trie operation or for checkpointed tries along a `commit()`) there is a new parameter `deleteFromDB` introduced which can be used to switch to a delete behavior on instantiation (the default is `false` here).

See: PR [#1219](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1219)

## 4.1.0 - 2021-02-16

This release comes with a reworked checkpointing mechanism (PR [#1030](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1030) and subsequently PR [#1035](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1035)). Instead of copying over the whole DB on checkpoints the operations in between checkpoints are now recorded in memory and either applied in batch on a `Trie.checkpoint()` call or discarded along a `Trie.revert()`. This more fine-grained operational mode leads to a substantial performance gain (up to 50x) when working with larger tries.

Another performance related bug has been fixed along PR [#127](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/127) removing an unnecessary double-serialization call on nodes. This gives a general performance gain of 10-20% on putting new values in a trie.

## New Features

A new exported `WalkController` class has been added and `trie.walkTrie()` has been made a public method along. This allows for creating own custom ways to traverse a trie. PR [#135](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/135)

### Refactoring, Development and Documentation

- Better `Trie` code documentation, PR [#125](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/125)
- Internal `Trie` function reordering & partial retwrite, PR [#125](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/125)
- Added simple integrated profiling, PR [#128](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/128)
- Reworked benchmarking to be based on `benchmark.js`, basic CI integration, PR [#130](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/130)
- Upgrade to `ethereumjs-config` `2.0` libs for linting and formatting, PR [#133](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/133)
- Switched coverage from `coverall` to `codecov`, PR [#137](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/137)

## [4.0.0] - 2020-04-17

This release introduces a major API upgrade from callbacks to Promises.

Example using async/await syntax:

```typescript
import { BaseTrie as Trie } from 'merkle-patricia-tree'
const trie = new Trie()
async function test() {
  await trie.put(Buffer.from('test'), Buffer.from('one'))
  const value = await trie.get(Buffer.from('test'))
  console.log(value.toString()) // 'one'
}
test()
```

### Breaking Changes

#### Trie methods

See the [docs](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/tree/master/docs) for the latest Promise-based method signatures.

#### Trie.prove renamed to Trie.createProof

To clarify the method's purpose `Trie.prove` has been renamed to `Trie.createProof`. `Trie.prove` has been deprecated but will remain as an alias for `Trie.createProof` until removed.

#### Trie raw methods

`getRaw`, `putRaw` and `delRaw` were deprecated in `v3.0.0` and have been removed from this release. Instead, please use `trie.db.get`, `trie.db.put`, and `trie.db.del`. If using a `SecureTrie` or `CheckpointTrie`, use `trie._maindb` to override the checkpointing mechanism and interact directly with the db.

#### SecureTrie.copy

`SecureTrie.copy` now includes checkpoint metadata by default. To maintain original behavior of _not_ copying checkpoint state, pass `false` to param `includeCheckpoints`.

[4.0.0]: https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0

## [3.0.0] - 2019-01-03

This release comes along with some major version bump of the underlying `level`
database storage backend. If you have the library deeper integrated in one of
your projects make sure that the new DB version plays well with the rest of the
code.

The release also introduces modern `ES6` JavaScript for the library (thanks @alextsg)
switching to `ES6` classes and clean inheritance on all the modules.

- Replace `levelup` 1.2.1 + `memdown` 1.0.0 with `level-mem` 3.0.1 and upgrade `level-ws` to 1.0.0, PR [#56](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/56)
- Support for `ES6` classes, PRs [#57](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/57), [#61](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/61)
- Updated `async` and `readable-stream` dependencies (resulting in smaller browser builds), PR [#60](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/60)
- Updated, automated and cleaned up [API documentation](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/blob/master/docs/index.md) build, PR [#63](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/63)
